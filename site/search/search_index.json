This is a place to showcase what's in progress rather than focusing on polished results or perfect performance. It's a window into my mind, where you can explore what I'm learning, creating, and thinking about, even when it's still taking shape.</p> <p>Here, everything is a work in progress\u2014an ever-evolving collection of my experiments, curiosities, and passions. I believe that creativity doesn't need to be perfect to be shared, and sometimes the best ideas come from the messiest drafts. In this space, you'll find projects in different stages of development, from the first sparks of inspiration to almost-finished works. It\u2019s less about the destination and more about the journey of discovery.</p> <p>Feel free to explore, comment, and connect with me along the way. Whether you're here to gain insights, offer feedback, or simply follow along with my latest endeavors, I hope this garden of ideas sparks your own creativity</p>"},{"location":"#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"}]}
