This is a place to showcase what's in progress rather than focusing on polished results or perfect performance. It's a window into my mind, where you can explore what I'm learning, creating, and thinking about, even when it's still taking shape.</p> <p>Here, everything is a work in progress\u2014an ever-evolving collection of my experiments, curiosities, and passions. I believe that creativity doesn't need to be perfect to be shared, and sometimes the best ideas come from the messiest drafts. In this space, you'll find projects in different stages of development, from the first sparks of inspiration to almost-finished works. It\u2019s less about the destination and more about the journey of discovery.</p> <p>Feel free to explore, comment, and connect with me along the way. Whether you're here to gain insights, offer feedback, or simply follow along with my latest endeavors, I hope this garden of ideas sparks your own creativity</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>My name is Jos\u00e9 Tandavala, I started my career as a web developer in 2014 in my hometown (Lobito) building software for small and medium-sized companies.

Well designed code is easier to extend, debug, and maintain, saving countless hours over a project's lifetime. But what if your software could be as robust and adaptable as it is functional? The secret lies in its structure. </p> <p>Foundational design principles are the backbone of high-quality software, making your code easier to extend, debug, and maintain saving you time and headaches as your project grows.</p> <p>In this session, you'll discover four essential design principles that transcend languages and frameworks. Whether you're new to coding or a seasoned engineer, these guidelines will help you build cleaner, more resilient systems. </p> <p>Here's what we'll cover:</p> <ul> <li>Encapsulate What Varies </li> <li>Favor Composition Over Inheritance </li> <li>Program to interfaces not implementations </li> <li>Loose coupling</li> </ul>"},{"location":"psychology/","title":"Overview","text":""},{"location":"psychology/#why-do-i-study-psychology","title":"Why Do I Study Psychology?","text":"<p>Psychology is an essential science in the modern world because it helps us understand human behavior, mental processes, and emotions.
