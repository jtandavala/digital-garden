My name is Jos√© Tandavala, I started my career as a web developer in 2014 in my hometown (Lobito) building software for small and medium-sized companies. Currently, I work as a Senior software developer in a multinational company based in Luanda building software for various industries namely: civil engineering, logistics, financial, telecommunications, HR, etc.
