Great software isn't just about functionality it's about structure. Well designed code is easier to extend, debug, and maintain, saving countless hours over a project's lifetime. But what if your software could be as robust and adaptable as it is functional? The secret lies in its structure. 

Foundational design principles are the backbone of high-quality software, making your code easier to extend, debug, and maintain saving you time and headaches as your project grows.

In this session, you'll discover four essential design principles that transcend languages and frameworks. Whether you're new to coding or a seasoned engineer, these guidelines will help you build cleaner, more resilient systems. 

Here's what we'll cover:

- Encapsulate What Varies 
- Favor Composition Over Inheritance 
- Program to interfaces not implementations 
- Loose coupling
